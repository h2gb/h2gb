# libh2gb

We need to write some parent documentation still!

## Documentation

This documentation is automatically generated from source files. This file
comes from [src/lib.rs](src/lib.rs), and the files listed below come from
their respective mod.rs files.

These are generated using `cargo readme`,
[from here](https://github.com/livioribeiro/cargo-readme). The script that
does it is a pre-commit hook, [update-readme-md.sh](hooks/pre-commit.d/update-readme-md.sh).

If you haven't already, you can install the pre-commit and pre-push hooks
by running [./install-hooks.sh](/install-hooks.sh) in the root folder.
