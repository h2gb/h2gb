* Displaying the binary needs to be WAY more efficient - MultipleSpawnPoints.plr (46kb) is slowwwww and slows down as it goes
* Add some way to 'peek' rather than actually creating an entry
* Print out structs better (like, each field gets its own thing)
* Can we somehow do comments on struct fields? :-/
* Print unallocated addresses
* Figure out better way to report errors

* Cross references
* Named addresses

* Move around modules in transformation/ so the transforms are in transform/
* Write tests for character types in GenericNumber
* Eliminate u64 as much as possible, in favour of usize
